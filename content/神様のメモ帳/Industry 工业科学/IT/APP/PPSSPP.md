## PPSSPP

PPSSPP 对显卡要求很低，核显都行。

What are the PC CPU and GPU requirements?
Any reasonably modern CPU will be just fine, and any GPU that can handle OpenGL 2.0 should have no issues. You should make sure to install the latest graphics drivers available though. Windows Vista or later is required, Windows 7 or higher is recommended. Vulkan will likely help performance where available, also try D3D9 or D3D11 if OpenGL is slow by changing the backend in settings. On some older computers, you may need to use the D3D9 backend.
